            <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
                <p>In my last year of highschool I partook in a speedcourse of informatics. This included computer science and programming. We were taught how to think like a programmer but the language we used was python. Apart from that I also took a bunch of courses for Java and video editing.</p>
