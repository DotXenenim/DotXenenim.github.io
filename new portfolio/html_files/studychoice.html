            <h2>Study Choice</h2>
            <p>I chose this program because I have always had a passion for it. Even when I was starting highschool I knew I wanted to go study ICT abroad. 
                Creating projects is always a fun process (although it can be hard sometimes) but seeing the final product that I can be proud of is a great feeling.
